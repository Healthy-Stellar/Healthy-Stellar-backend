### Directories that need cleanup ⚠️

The following directories are **named after GitHub issues** rather than their domain, which makes the codebase harder to navigate. They contain valid implementations but should be renamed or merged in a future clean-up PR.

| Directory | Status | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| `src/Auto-Generate TypeScript Client SDK from OpenAPI Spec/` | Duplicate — CI workflows only | Move workflows to `.github/workflows/`; delete directory |
| `src/SwaggerOpenAPI Documentation with Full Schema Coverage/` | Contains `export-openapi.ts` | Move script to `scripts/`; delete directory |
| `src/Profile and Optimize Database Query Performance Under Load/` | Contains benchmark scripts | Merge into `scripts/`; delete directory |
| `src/profile-and-optimize-database-query-performance-under-load/` | Duplicate of above (different casing) | Delete after merging |
| `src/Dockerfile and Docker Compose for Production-Ready Containerization/` | Contains CI yml files | Move to `.github/workflows/`; delete directory |
| `src/Build Admin Analytics Dashboard Endpoints/` | Unclear overlap with `analytics/` | Audit and merge or delete |
| `src/Telemedicine and Remote/` | Contains spaces in name; likely overlaps with… | Merge into `telemedicine-and-remote/` and delete |
| `src/telemedicine-and-remote/` | …this directory | Keep this one; delete the spaced variant |
| `src/Tenant Provisioning and Onboarding Workflow/` | Overlaps with… | Merge into `tenant-provisioning-and-onboarding-workflow/` |
| `src/tenant-provisioning-and-onboarding-workflow/` | …this directory | Keep; delete the spaced variant |
| `src/Department and Ward Management/` | Unclear if wired into app.module | Audit and either wire or delete |
| `src/Surgical Management System/` | Unclear if wired into app.module | Audit and either wire or delete |
| `src/Email Notification Service for Critical Access Events/` | Likely superseded by `notifications/` | Audit and delete if redundant |
| `src/Hospital config/` | Likely superseded by `hospital-registry/` | Audit and merge or delete |
| `src/Migration-CLI/` | Likely superseded by TypeORM CLI scripts | Audit and delete if redundant |
| `src/modules/` | Contains a `patient` sub-module alongside `src/patients/` | Audit which is canonical; delete the other |

> Track clean-up work in a dedicated issue. Do not import from the spaced-name directories in new code.

## Local Development with Docker

| Service  | Container   | Port(s)                | Purpose                    |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| api      | hs-api      | 3000                   | NestJS app with hot reload |
| worker   | hs-worker   | -                      | BullMQ queue processors    |
| postgres | hs-postgres | 5432                   | PostgreSQL 15              |
| redis    | hs-redis    | 6379                   | Redis 7                    |
| mailhog  | hs-mailhog  | 1025 (SMTP), 8025 (UI) | Local email capture        |

```bash
cp .env.docker .env.docker.local
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml exec api npm run migration:run
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml exec api npm run seed
```

- API: http://localhost:3000
- Swagger: http://localhost:3000/api
- MailHog: http://localhost:8025

The `src/` directory is bind-mounted; NestJS runs with `--watch` so changes reload automatically.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f api      # Follow API logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f worker   # Follow Worker logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down             # keep volumes
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down -v          # wipe volumes
```

> `.env.docker` contains placeholder secrets for local use only. Never use outside local dev.

## Background Worker Process

The backend application uses [BullMQ](https://bullmq.io/) for managing and executing background queues. This is essential for offloading heavy operations or interacting with the Stellar blockchain without blocking the main HTTP event loop of the API service.

The worker process is defined in `src/worker.ts` and `src/worker.module.ts`.

> For how `src/blockchain/`, `src/stellar/`, and `src/stellar-stream/` fit
> together and interact with this worker process — including which parts are
> fully wired up versus built-but-not-yet-connected — see
> [`docs/STELLAR_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/STELLAR_ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Key Responsibilities

The worker processes tasks from several queues:

- **`contract-writes`**: Schedules and signs write transactions to Stellar Soroban smart contracts.
- **`stellar-transactions`**: Manages blockchain transaction submission and retry logic.
- **`event-indexing`**: Scrapes and indexes events emitted by the smart contracts.
- **`ipfs-uploads`**: Uploads records/PHI hashes to IPFS.
- **`email-notifications`**: Sends transactional and notification emails.
- **`reports`**: Processes PDF/CSV healthcare compliance report generation.
- **`fhir-bulk-export` / `ehr-import`**: Processes FHIR/EHR batch data imports and exports.

### Running the Worker

#### With Docker Compose (Local Dev)

The worker is included in `docker-compose.local.yml` and runs automatically when you spin up the project:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build
```

#### Bare Metal (Without Docker)

If you run the NestJS API locally using `npm run start:dev`, you **MUST** also start the worker process in a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run start:worker:dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
Swagger documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000/api`

## Scripts Reference

The project has 66 npm scripts. A full reference — including descriptions, prerequisites, and safety warnings for destructive scripts — is in **[docs/scripts.md](docs/scripts.md)**.

Quick-start summary:

```bash
npm run start:dev          # API with hot-reload
npm run migration:run      # apply pending DB migrations
npm run seed               # load development reference data
npm run test               # unit tests
npm run test:e2e           # end-to-end tests (requires Docker)
npm run load-test:ci       # k6 load test + CI gate (requires k6)
npm run build:sdk          # build the TypeScript client SDK
```

## Configuration

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

`.env.example` is the authoritative reference for every environment variable the application reads. Variables are grouped by area and annotated with:

- `[REQUIRED]` — must be set before the app starts in production
- `[OPTIONAL]` — has a safe default; override only when needed
- `[SECRET]` — never commit the real value; use a secrets manager in production

**Key sections in `.env.example`:**

| Section | Variables |
|---|---|
| Application | `NODE_ENV`, `PORT`, `API_URL`, `APP_BASE_URL` |
| Database (primary) | `DATABASE_URL` / `DB_HOST` … `DB_POOL_MAX` |
| Database (read replica) | `DB_REPLICA_HOST` … `DB_REPLICA_POOL_MAX` |
| Redis | `REDIS_URL` / `REDIS_HOST` … `REDIS_DB` |
| JWT & Auth | `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRATION`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` |
| Encryption / KMS | `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY`, `MASTER_KEY`, `KMS_ENABLED`, `AWS_*` |
| Stellar / Soroban | `STELLAR_SECRET_KEY`, `STELLAR_CONTRACT_ID`, `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` |
| IPFS | `IPFS_NODE_URL`, `IPFS_GATEWAY`, `IPFS_FALLBACK_GATEWAY` |
| Email / SMTP | `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` |
| Telemedicine | `TELEMEDICINE_SIGNALING_URL`, `TELEMEDICINE_TOKEN_SECRET` |
| Research export | `RESEARCH_EXPORT_BUCKET`, `RESEARCH_K_ANONYMITY` |
| EHR import | `EHR_IMPORT_S3_BUCKET`, `EHR_IMPORT_MAX_RETRIES` |
| GraphQL subscriptions | `SUBSCRIPTIONS_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `SUBSCRIPTIONS_MAX_PER_CONNECTION` |
| Ops / alerting | `OPS_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, `QUEUE_DEPTH_THRESHOLD` |
| Migrations | `MIGRATION_EXECUTOR`, `CONFIRM_PRODUCTION_MIGRATION` |

## Security Headers

The API applies `helmet()` in `src/main.ts` using the shared configuration in `src/security/http-security.config.ts`.

**Prerequisites:** Node.js v18+, PostgreSQL v12+

1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set up environment variables:
   `cp .env.example .env`
3. Run database migrations:
   `npm run migration:run`
4. **Seed the database with test data:**
   `npm run seed`
   _(Why added: This generates fake users, medical records, and access grants via `src/database/seeder.ts` so you can log in and test the application)._
5. Start the development server:
   `npm run start:dev`
6. Start the background job worker process:
   `npm run start:worker:dev`

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Key sections:

### Data residency and multi-region routing

The backend supports region-aware tenant database routing across four regions: **EU**, **US**, **APAC**, and **AFRICA**. Each tenant declares a residency region and, when `strictDataResidency` is enabled, requests are rejected with `403 Forbidden` if they attempt to access data outside the configured region.

Each region has its own set of environment variables for database, Stellar Horizon, and IPFS configuration:

| Variable                     | Region | Description                                           | Default                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `DEFAULT_REGION`             | global | Default region for new tenants                        | `EU`                                   |

Tenant example:

```json
{
  "region": "EU",
  "strictDataResidency": true
}
```

When a policy violation occurs, the API returns:

```text
403 Forbidden
Tenant data residency policy prohibits access outside the configured region.
```

For local development, the routing service initializes SQLite-backed regional datasources so tests and simulations can verify region selection without a full multi-database deployment.

```

## Security Headers

Configured via `helmet()` in `src/main.ts` using `src/security/http-security.config.ts`:

- `Content-Security-Policy` — restricts script/style/asset sources to prevent XSS
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` — blocks clickjacking via iframes
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` — prevents MIME-type sniffing
- `Strict-Transport-Security` — enforces HTTPS
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` — suppresses referrer leakage
- `X-XSS-Protection: 0` — disables legacy browser XSS filter in favour of CSP

## API Endpoints

The complete route reference is available in the [Swagger UI](/api) when the
application is running and in the generated [OpenAPI specification](docs/openapi.json).

## Webhooks

Tenants can subscribe to healthcare events (record uploads, access grants, diagnosis
updates, and more). Deliveries are signed with HMAC-SHA256 (`X-Webhook-Signature`),
retried with exponential backoff, replayable from the dead-letter queue, and the
platform also receives signed inbound callbacks from IPFS, Stellar and insurance
payers.

See the [webhook integrator guide](docs/webhooks.md) for the delivery headers,
signature verification snippets (Node and Python), secret rotation semantics, retry
and alerting behaviour, manual replay, the event catalog, and the inbound signing
scheme.

## Postman Collection

Import [`docs/postman/MedChain.postman_collection.json`](docs/postman/MedChain.postman_collection.json). Environments: Local, Testnet, Staging. The collection is generated from OpenAPI; see [how to regenerate the API references](docs/OPENAPI_REGENERATION.md).

## Database Schema

The authoritative database schema is defined by the [TypeORM migrations](src/migrations/)
and corresponding entity definitions in `src/`.

## Error Handling

All non-FHIR errors return a consistent envelope (`statusCode`, `error`, `message`, `code`, `traceId`, `timestamp`, `path`, `details`). Clients should branch on the machine-readable `code` — one of the `AppErrorCode` values — rather than on `message` or the HTTP status. `GlobalExceptionFilter` is the effective handler: it maps errors to codes, logs them with a `traceId`, and withholds internal details (stack traces) from responses. Routes under `/fhir` return an HL7 FHIR `OperationOutcome` instead.

See [`docs/errors.md`](docs/errors.md) for the full error-code catalog (HTTP status, meaning, and retryability for every code), the exception-filter order, sanitization rules, and how `traceId` maps to logs and tracing for support requests.

See **[docs/scripts.md](docs/scripts.md)** for the full list of test scripts and their prerequisites.

### Quick reference

```bash
npm run test        # unit
npm run test:e2e    # e2e
npm run test:cov    # coverage
```

# Unit tests with coverage
npm run test:cov

# E2E tests (requires Docker — starts a PostgreSQL container)
npm run test:e2e

# Full coverage (unit + e2e)
npm run test:all:cov

# HIPAA/GDPR compliance tests
npm run test:compliance
```

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

Set `NODE_ENV=production`, configure DB credentials, CORS, HTTPS, and logging before deploying.

For operational procedures used during deployment, recovery, and maintenance — key
rotation, migration safety, break-glass review, reconciliation, dead-letter queue
replay, projection rebuilds, and backup/restore — see the
[operator runbooks](docs/runbooks/README.md).

## Handsoff notes

<!-- handsoff-issue-1062 -->
- #1062: [High] `GdprProcessor.onModuleInit()` — GDPR erasure cascade omits the surgical-management-system module

<!-- handsoff-issue-1064 -->
- #1064: [High] `SurgicalService.updateSurgicalCase()` reschedule path bypasses the advisory lock, allowing double-booking on reschedule

<!-- handsoff-issue-1074 -->
- #1074: [Medium] `IncidentTrackingService.generateIncidentNumber()` — non-atomic count-then-format allows duplicate incident numbers under concurrency

<!-- handsoff-issue-1075 -->
- #1075: Patients: remove or reconcile the duplicate, unregistered patient module in `src/modules/patient`
